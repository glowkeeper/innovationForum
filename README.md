## Bitcoin's High Energy Demand

Buried deep within my 2016 paper [Socialism and the Blockchain](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi8040049), were some calculations of the 2014 total energy consumption of mining on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) network. I estimated that as 3.38 terawatt-hours (TWh); to put that in context, the 2.72 million people of Jamaica used 3.03 TWh of electricity that same year.

During 2018, newspaper articles also began noting Bitcoin's high energy demand ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shermanlee/2018/04/19/bitcoins-energy-consumption-can-power-an-entire-country-but-eos-is-trying-to-fix-that/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/09/why-bitcoin-uses-so-much-energy)). By the time [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0152-7) published their article in early November 2018, I  was moved to reply; I did so with my article on [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282). There, I acknowledged the high energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, but argued that the decentralised architecture of the technology could help create models of production that countered the hierarchies of Capitalism. Thus, such energy use was a price worth paying, because it offered an alternative to a system that was creating many problems, not least, climate change. Besides, I argued that, if we were to avoid dramatic change, we needed to move to cleaner energy sources. If we did, humanity would benefit, and as a by-product, so would Bitcoin.

Also buried deep within [Socialism and the Blockchain](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi8040049) is an idea for a cryptocurrency which links its value to the amount of energy consumed by the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network. I included a similar idea in an early draft of my PhD thesis. A colleague who read that early draft thought it was the best part of the entire piece! They couldn't help thinking it deserved more than the paltry paragraph I had devoted to it! Hence, I have since developed that idea, in the form of [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator), a cryptocurrency that links its value to the world's total primary energy supply and per capita energy use. It does so in a way that incentivises efficiency - if energy use goes down, [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator)'s value goes up.

## Summary

Honestly? Although at the time, my article for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/bitcoins-high-energy-consumption-is-a-concern-but-it-may-be-a-price-worth-paying-106282) was by far the most read piece by a Sussex academic on that platform, I couldn't help worrying that my argument was tenuous, at best. I wanted something more concrete to address the criticisms of the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) is that.

This presentation introduces [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator), demonstrates its value mechanisms, shows how it might be exchanged for a sovereign currency, then discusses some barriers to its uptake.
